# HW #2: Responsive Portfilio 
# Due: Saturday, November 14, 2020 @ 11:59pm Local

## User Story
This is a responsive Portfolio Website, designed and coded by Peter A Cardillo.  The site will be using Bootstrap for layout and design.  Some custom CSS styles have been added and are located in the respective .html files.  I did not include a seperate css style sheet since the majority of the style is managed by Bootstrap and the styles I added - I want to be explicitly seen in the .html file they are being applied.

The primary purpose of this website is to describe the developers skillsets, 
show previous work and request contact information for potential work.


## There are 3 pages in this application addressing this purpose:
* About/Home page
* Contact page
* Portfolio page

5. Submit the link to the gitHub repository
6. Submit the link to the live application
7. Include a descriptive README file
